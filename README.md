# Summer Movie Wager 2019
## Serverless scrapping and Gatsby deployment via AWS Amplify

### Description
The intention of this repo is to:
  * Use a serverless project to scrap data from a specified site
  * Use the scrapped data to generate a static site using Gatsby.js

This was due to me wanting a different way of visualizing the data that was available from https://thesummermoviewager.com in a easier to comprehend manner for the people who I was playing with. This was my first project also into using Gatsby and trying to understand how it works.

#### The Serverless Functionality
The serverless portion of this project has its own directory located [here](scraper-serverless/readme.md).

What this scrapper does is the following:
  * Sets up a cron schedule for a lambda function to run
  * The lambda function uses a combination of [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) and [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) to visit the specified Summer Movie Wager page (the page which contains you and your team's movie picks) and selects certain DOM elements, parses them, and saves them to a S3 Bucket.
  * :warning: The cron schedule can be any cron expression you want, but I only triggered it to run once a day to be kind to the original website. :warning:

```
Cron -> Lambda -> S3
```

#### Gatsby Framework
The Gatsby portion of this project requests the data to populate the site via the S3 bucket. The S3 Bucket contains the JSON object that is generated by the serverless component.

```
S3 -> Gatsby
```

Gatsby Configurations required:
  * `.env.production` and `.env.development` are used for these values:
    * `GATSBY_SUMMOVWAG_LOC` - The location of the S3 bucket that contains the data required to populate the site
    * `GATSBY_SUMMOVWAG_SITE` - The location of the original Summer Movie Wager site for your specific team.

Through AWS Amplify, you can specific [Environment Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html) via their GUI. Any enviornment variables set locally must be replicated via the Amplify Console.

For posterity, I've chosen to keep the players and their picks in this repo via the [playersPicksList.js](src/components/playersPicksList.js) file.

Feel free to clone this repo and have this data fetched in a similar fashion with how Gatsby is fetching the data to populate the site.

Images used within this repo are not mine, but were taken from BoxOfficeMojo.com. These images represent a player's specific picks in an easier to understand fashion.


Below is the default Gatsby README.md that comes with every Gatsby project.

  Gatsby's default starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
